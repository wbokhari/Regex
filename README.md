Update syntax of all sql files in a directory

Create a C# console app and replace your program.cs file with this program.cs.

This code does the following:

1, Search through all files in a folder

2, Find files with contains certain keyword

3, Find Line Number which contains this keyword

4, Parse Line to extract keywords that make sense syntatically

5, Reconstruct line in proper syntax

6, Rewrite line in each file according to new syntax

With very minor tweaks, this can be used to update old syntax to new syntax across file structures.
